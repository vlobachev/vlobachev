## 🧠 About Me

I’m a systems engineer with 15+ years of experience in IT, focused on building resilient, scalable, and reproducible platforms — from bare-metal environments to cloud-native and AI-powered infrastructures.  
I treat infrastructure as a product and pipelines as craft, always aiming for simplicity, automation, and transparency.
